# Simple Ejabberd server

This directory contains a very simple and basic ejabberd configuration file that is a nice match to get started
with integrating Ejabberd with WorkAdventure.

It is the simplest possible installation.

- It does not connect to other XMPP servers
- It does not store anything
- All users are transient and authenticated anonymously
